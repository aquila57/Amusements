# Roulette Game

This repository contains a simple roulette game based on a random number
generator.  This version of roulette uses a curses screen to display a
menu of betting options.  Once you select a betting option, the game
asks you to place a bet.  If the betting amount is valid, the game
generates a random number from 0 to 37.  Number 37 is reser4ved for
double zero.  The game tells you if you win or lose and either credits
or debits your pile of cash.  If you continue to lose, your pile of
cash goes negative.  There is no limit for how much virtual money
you can win or lose.  The maximum bet is 1 billion dollars.

This version of roulette only includes inner bets.

Every time the game asks you to enter a number, you type the number and
then you press the Enter key to enter the number.

All prizes are calculated based on standard roulette payouts.

For example, red, black, even, and odd pay one to one, according to
standard roulette payouts.

All betting and prizes are made with virtual dollars.  Your pile of
cash starts at zero every time you start the game.
